# CS371p: Object-Oriented Programming Darwin Repo

* Name: Karah Phang and Katherine Liang

* EID: kp33527 and Xl5878

* GitLab ID: karahphang and katherineliang100

* Git SHA: 95b88429dd3191a4232eacfc49d3a28397273333

* GitLab Pipelines: https://gitlab.com/karahphang/cs371p-darwin-tests/-/jobs/8356814239 (pipeline for the darwin in and out)

* Estimated completion time: 13 hours

* Actual completion time: 15 hours

* Comments: I think the only reason I'm failing the pipeline for the in and out file is a newline difference because that's the only difference I could find when I ran "make run-all" on my device. I also don't know my partner's EID but they may add it later.
